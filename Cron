The two main wais to edit the crontab are using the crontab -e command or to manually edit a cron file.

On some systems, you will cron with items such as cron.hourly, cron.daily,cron.weekly,cron.monthly. These are directories that contain scripts that will run hourly,daily,weekly,monthly, etc... If your system does have these configurted then you shoul audit the /etc/cron.XXXX directories for scripts.
