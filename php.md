#php.ini is where the config file is.
Here is a list of critical items to help secure a webserver using PHP. 
- Whitelist include directories 
	- `open_basedir = "/home/user/public_html:/var/lib/php/tmp_upload:/var/lib/php/session"`
		- This is an example you may need to modify paths
- Disable url_fopen and url_include
	- 'allow_url_fopen = off'
- Reduce run time / input time 
	- 'max_input_time = 30'
	- 'max_execution_time = 30'
- Set a tight memory limit ( memory_limit )
- Disable showing php version ( expose_php )
	- 'expose_php = Off'
- Force php to only run via webserver and not direct access (cgi.force_redirect = 1)
- Limit input and upload sizes. (post max size can break file uploads. If there is a requirement for large uploads this value needs to be bigger )
	- 'post_max_size = 256K' 
	- 'max_input_vars = 100'
- Limit file upload size
	- 'file_uploads = 1'  
	- 'upload_max_filesize = 1M'
	- Try to keep  `upload_max_filesize` as small as possible. This effects things like reverse shells from being uploaded if you can get it small enough.  Again this will be an issue if your website has a requirement to upload files.
- Change and RESTRICT a temporary file directory 
	- (upload_tmp_dir = /var/lib/php/tmp_upload
	- By default, temporary file uploads are placed in a directory that is writeable by all system users. Lock down where you set this so files cannout execute from the directory.
- Disable error messages from showing on webpages
	- 'display_errors = 0 ' 
	- 'display_startup_errors = 0'
- Enable a log file
	- 'log_errors = 1 ' 
	- 'error_log = /home/user/error_log'
